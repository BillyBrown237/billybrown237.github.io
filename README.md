# billybrown237.github.io

Personal link-in-bio page hosted on GitHub Pages — a single entry point to everything I'm building and everywhere I am online.

## What's here

A minimal, custom-built link hub with:
- Dark / light mode toggle (remembers your preference)
- Links to my portfolio, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter/X
- My current tech stack at a glance

No frameworks, no dependencies, no build step — just one `index.html` file.

## Stack

Plain HTML · CSS · Vanilla JS

## Live

[billybrown237.github.io](https://billybrown237.github.io)

## Local preview

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/billybrown237/billybrown237.github.io.git

# Open in browser
open index.html
```

## Customization

All links are in `index.html` — search for `your-handle` and `your-portfolio.com` and replace with your real URLs.
